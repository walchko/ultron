  --compatibility             If set, Compose will attempt to convert keys

  up                 Create and start containers
  version            Show the Docker-Compose version information

```

This manages containers so you don't have to. If spun up and the yaml has an entry
for `restart`, then it will be restarted after a shutdown/reboot.

Useful Commands:

- `docker-compose up -d`: starts a docker container and detaches (`-d`) it into the background
- `docker-compose down`: shuts down and removes containers, networks, images, and volumes
