I am grouping some of my docker containers together:

- Pi Hole ![Docker Image Size (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/pihole/pihole)
- Octoprint ![Docker Image Size (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/octoprint/octoprint)
- Debian Linux ![Docker Image Size (tag)](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/walchko/debian/latest)
- Rocky Linux ![Docker Image Size (tag)](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/walchko/rocky/latest)

## Instructions for Using Existing Images from DockerHub

- Run `docker-compose` pull to get latest image
- Run `docker-compose up -d` to get things going
    - `-d` will detach it from the terminal, you can omit and use `ctrl-c` to shut it down
- Terminate with `docker-compose down`
- You **must** be in this sub folder with the `docker-compose.yaml` to run `up` and `down` commands


## Instructions for Building Images

1. `cd` into folder
1. `docker-compose build --compress --force-rm --no-cache --pull --parallel`
    1. `--compress` - Compress the build context using gzip
    2. `--force-rm` - Always remove intermediate containers
    3. `--no-cache` - Do not use cache when building the image
    4. `--pull` - Always attempt to pull a newer version of the image
    5. `--parallel` - Build images in parallel
1. To run container:
    1. Attached in foreground: `docker-compose up`
    1. Detached in backgroud: `docker-compose up -d`
1. `docker-compose down` to stop and clean-up

## Publish to DockerHub

1. `docker login`
1. `docker-compose push`
1. `docker logout`

## `docker-compose` Help

```bash
docker-compose -h
Define and run multi-container applications with Docker.

Usage:
  docker-compose [-f <arg>...] [options] [COMMAND] [ARGS...]
  docker-compose -h|--help

Options:
  -f, --file FILE             Specify an alternate compose file
                              (default: docker-compose.yml)
  -p, --project-name NAME     Specify an alternate project name
                              (default: directory name)
  --verbose                   Show more output
  --log-level LEVEL           Set log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  --no-ansi                   Do not print ANSI control characters
  -v, --version               Print version and exit
  -H, --host HOST             Daemon socket to connect to

  --tls                       Use TLS; implied by --tlsverify
  --tlscacert CA_PATH         Trust certs signed only by this CA
  --tlscert CLIENT_CERT_PATH  Path to TLS certificate file
  --tlskey TLS_KEY_PATH       Path to TLS key file
  --tlsverify                 Use TLS and verify the remote
  --skip-hostname-check       Don't check the daemon's hostname against the
                              name specified in the client certificate
  --project-directory PATH    Specify an alternate working directory
                              (default: the path of the Compose file)
  --compatibility             If set, Compose will attempt to convert keys
                              in v3 files to their non-Swarm equivalent
  --env-file PATH             Specify an alternate environment file

Commands:
  build              Build or rebuild services
  config             Validate and view the Compose file
  create             Create services
  down               Stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes
  events             Receive real time events from containers
  exec               Execute a command in a running container
  help               Get help on a command
  images             List images
  kill               Kill containers
  logs               View output from containers
  pause              Pause services
  port               Print the public port for a port binding
  ps                 List containers
  pull               Pull service images
  push               Push service images
  restart            Restart services
  rm                 Remove stopped containers
  run                Run a one-off command
  scale              Set number of containers for a service
  start              Start services
  stop               Stop services
  top                Display the running processes
  unpause            Unpause services
  up                 Create and start containers
  version            Show the Docker-Compose version information

```

This manages containers so you don't have to. If spun up and the yaml has an entry
for `restart`, then it will be restarted after a shutdown/reboot.

## Cleaning Up

Docker is a pain in the ass to get rid of unneeded things. Try:

```
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
docker system prune -a -f
docker images prune -a
docker volume prune -f
docker container prune -f
# docker rmi $(docker ps -q)
docker rmi $(docker images -a -q) # delete all images
docker rm $(docker ps -aq) # delete all containers
```

## `docker-compose`

```yaml
---
version: '3'

services:
  debian:
    build: .
    image: walchko/debian:0.1
    container_name: debiancontainer
    hostname: debianhost
    ports:
      # - "443:443/tcp"
      - "2222:22/tcp"
```

```
